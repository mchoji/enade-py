# enade-py

 A library for facilitating data analysis over Enade microdata.


## Description

*enade-py* comprises a set of functions for helping researchers and Educational
Data Mining (EDM) enthusiasts through the data mining process using Enade
microdata.

The Enade microdata datasets are provided by [Inep] and consist of informations from brazilian
undergraduate students and their performance on Enade (a national exam taken at
the end of the course).

Enade datasets contain attributes related to:

* the exam itself;
* the student;
* the institution;
* performance on the exam;
* socioeconomic questions;
* and more.


## Getting Started

### Installing with pip
To install the latest release of *enade-py*, just run

```shell
pip install enade-py
```

### Manual Installation

In order to set up the necessary environment:

0. clone the repository on your machine
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mchoji/enade-py.git
   ```
1. create an environment `enade-py` with the help of [conda],
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   ```
2. activate the new environment with
   ```
   conda activate enade-py
   ```
3. install `enade-py` with:
   ```
   python setup.py install # or `develop`
   ```

Optional and needed only once after `git clone`:

4. install several [pre-commit] git hooks with:
   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```
   and checkout the configuration under `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   The `-n, --no-verify` flag of `git commit` can be used to deactivate pre-commit hooks temporarily.

5. install [nbstripout] git hooks to remove the output cells of committed notebooks with:
   ```
   nbstripout --install --attributes notebooks/.gitattributes
   ```
   This is useful to avoid large diffs due to plots in your notebooks.
   A simple `nbstripout --uninstall` will revert these changes.


Then take a look into the `scripts` and `notebooks` folders.

### Dependency Management & Reproducibility

1. Abstract (unpinned) dependencies are kept in `environment.yaml` (for
   development) and in `setup.cfg` (for `pip`)
2. Concrete dependencies are kept in `environment.lock.yaml` for the exact
   reproduction of the development environment with:
   ```
   conda env export -n enade-py -f environment.lock.yaml
   ```
   For multi-OS development, consider using `--no-builds` during the export.
3. Update your current environment with respect to a new `environment.lock.yaml` using:
   ```
   conda env update -f environment.lock.yaml --prune
   ```
4. Data files are tracked with [dvc]. To pull the latest version, run the
   following command after `git clone` or `git pull`:
   ```
   dvc pull
   ```
